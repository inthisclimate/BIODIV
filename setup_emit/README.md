# EMIT-Data-Resources  

Welcome to the EMIT-Data-Resources repository. This repository provides guides, short how-tos, and tutorials to help users access and work with data from the [Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) mission](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/data/get-started-data/collection-overview/missions/emit-overview/). In the interest of open science this repository has been made public but is still under active development. All notebooks and scripts should be functional, however, changes or additions may be made. Make sure to consult the [CHANGE_LOG.md](CHANGE_LOG.md) for the most recent changes to the repository. Contributions from all parties are welcome.

## EMIT Background  

The [EMIT](https://earth.jpl.nasa.gov/emit/) Project delivers space-based measurements of surface mineralogy of the Earth’s arid dust source regions. These measurements are used to initialize the compositional makeup of dust sources in Earth System Models (ESMs). The dust cycle, which describe the generation, lofting, transport, and deposition of mineral dust, plays an important role in ESMs. Dust composition is presently the largest uncertainty factor in quantifying the magnitude of aerosol direct radiative forcing. By understanding the composition of mineral dust sources, EMIT aims to constrain the sign and magnitude of dust-related radiative forcing at regional and global scales. During its one-year mission on the International Space Station (ISS), EMIT will make measurements over the sunlit Earth’s dust source regions that fall within ±52° latitude. EMIT will schedule up to five visits (three on average) of each arid target region and only acquisitions not dominated by cloud cover will be downlinked. EMIT-based maps of the relative abundance of source minerals will advance the understanding of the current and future impacts of mineral dust in the Earth system.  

EMIT Data Products are distributed by the [LP DAAC](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/).
